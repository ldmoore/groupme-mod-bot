## How to Contribute

### 1. Find or Open an Issue
- Check existing issues before creating new ones.
- File issues for **bugs**, **improvements**, or **spam filter updates**.
- Keep each issue focused—one topic per issue.

### 2. Create a Branch
Pull from the `staging` branch and use descriptive branch names:
```
feature/add-new-filter
fix/deletion-timing-bug
docs/improve-readme
```

### 3. Make Effective Changes
- **Do:** Focused, meaningful PRs that solve one problem.
- **Don’t:** Submit cosmetic or stylistic rewrites unless discussed first.
- **Avoid:** Reformatting code, switching English dialects, or personal style tweaks.


### 4. Submit a Pull Request
1. Keep your PR clear and concise.
2. Explain **why** the change matters.
3. Be patient. 
4. PRs should be made against the `staging` branch except when promoting changes from `staging` to `main`.

## Open Source Etiquette

Inspired by [MDN Web Docs’ Open Source Etiquette](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Open_source_etiquette) and [Nathan Santiago](https://ik.imagekit.io/163nb9q5a/Photo%20from%20Google%20Photos%20(4).JPG?updatedAt=1761433597323):

- **Be kind and respectful.** Everyone here’s trying to help.
- **Say thanks.** A little appreciation goes a long way.
- **Ask before assuming.** Don’t presume experience or background.
- **Stay on topic.** Keep discussions relevant and focused.
- **Make progress, not noise.** One issue = one topic, one PR = one fix.

## Code Style

- Use Biome 2.3.0 for formatting conventions.
- Keep code readable and consistent.
- Comment clearly when logic is non-obvious.
